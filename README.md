# ✈️ Delta Airlines Analytics Project
Welcome to another experience, thanks to **[Clicked](https://www.clicked.com/learning-experience-page/data-analytics-team-sprint-10-17-24?mode=module)**: Delta Airlines Analytics Project! 

This project was all about giving Delta Airlines a 5-year business strategy that can help them address market dynamics and regulatory requirements and keep a competitive edge in the industry. It goes into customer behavior, operational efficiency, and revenue optimization for Delta Airlines, using various data science techniques to uncover actionable insights.

## **📊 Project Overview**
Delta Airlines faces increasing competition from low-cost carriers and high regulatory pressures. This analysis aims to:

•	Understand customer engagement patterns

•	Segment customers based on loyalty and behavior

•	Optimize occupancy rates through predictive modeling

•	Provide recommendations to support a 5-year business strategy

## **🧩 Hypotheses I explored:**

**1.	Customer Segmentation for Retention:**

- Hypothesis: Customer segmentation based on loyalty and engagement metrics can identify customer types, allowing for targeted retention strategies.

- Outcome: Segmentation helped identify high-value customer groups that can be engaged with rewards or exclusive offers.

**2.	Operational Efficiency:**
- Hypothesis: Improving resource allocation on flights with low historical occupancy or high variability in demand will reduce costs and optimize occupancy.
- Outcome: Predictive models identified low-demand periods, enabling efficient resource planning.

**3.	Revenue Optimization:**
- Hypothesis: Offering targeted discounts and upgrades to loyalty members during low-demand periods will optimize seat occupancy rates and maintain revenue.
- Outcome: Model results indicated potential strategies for dynamic pricing and engagement-focused discounts.

## **📈 Analysis and Modeling**
- Customer Segmentation: K-Means clustering segmented customers based on loyalty, engagement, and checked bags, helping Delta to target high-value groups.
- Occupancy Prediction: Logistic regression and decision trees explored factors influencing occupancy rates.
- Revenue Analysis: Time series and regression models were used to understand the relationship between ticket prices, ancillary services, and revenue.

## **🔍 Key Visualizations**
- Confusion Matrix: Showed predictive accuracy and class imbalance challenges in logistic regression models.
- ROC Curve: Demonstrated the need for improved features to enhance model accuracy.
- Customer Segmentation Plot: Visualized customer clusters, helping Delta tailor engagement strategies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are 2 sets of data: Delta Airlines Loyalty data and siloed Revenue dataset
>
> The Delta Airlines Loyalty data contains 3 sheets of greater than 20,000 record.
>
> Data cleaning takes about 90% of the task
>
> Data standardization and formatting is 40% of the task
>
> Different models explored: Logistic regression model, K-Means clustering, and confusion matrices
 
Happy analyzing! 📊📈
